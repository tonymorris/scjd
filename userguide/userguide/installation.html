<p class="toctitle">Installation</p>
<p class="topictext">The installation begins with obtaining the single Java Archive 
  (JAR) file which makes up the entire assignment submission. This file is named 
  scjd-b<i>xxxx</i>.jar where xxxx is the build release number of the submission 
  file. This file contains all files required to perform the installation.</p>
<p><span class="topicsubtitle"><a name="packagecontents"></a>Package Contents</span></p>
<p class="topictext"><u>scjd-bxxxx.jar</u><br>
  <b>---- code</b><br>
  <b>---- docs</b><br>
  <b>-------- javadoc</b><br>
  -------- choices.txt<br>
  -------- instructions.html<br>
  -------- userguide.html<br>
  ---- runme.jar<br>
  ---- db-2x2.db<br>
  ---- version.txt </p>
<p class="topictext">&quot;scjd-bxxxx.jar&quot; is the top level submission file 
  where xxxx is the build release number of the assignment submission file.<br>
  &quot;code&quot; is a directory containing all the source code that makes up 
  the assignment submission.<br>
  &quot;docs&quot; is a directory containing documentation that is relevant to 
  the assignment submission.<br>
  &quot;javadoc&quot; is a directory containing JavaDoc documentation for all 
  the source code that makes up this assignment submission.<br>
  &quot;choices.txt&quot; is an ASCII text file that describes design decisions 
  made during development of the application.<br>
  &quot;instructions.html&quot; is an HTML file that was part of the assignment 
  download - this file remains unchanged.<br>
  &quot;userguide.html&quot; is one file of many HTML files that make up this 
  user guide. <br>
  &quot;runme.jar&quot; is the single executable Java Archive (JAR) file that 
  is required to execute the application.<br>
  &quot;db-2x2.db&quot; is a database file that was part of the assignment download 
  - this file remains unchanged.<br>
  &quot;version.txt&quot; is an ASCII text file that specifies the development 
  and test platform of the application.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="systemreq"></a>System Requirements</p>
<p class="topictext">The application requires a Java 2 Software Development Kit 
  version 1.4 or higher in order to run. Memory requirements are that of the installed 
  Java 2 SDK. The client machine must have a direct connection to the server machine 
  (no Network Address Translation) and no firewall to prevent access over Remote 
  Method Invocation (RMI). </p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="installing"></a>Installing </p>
<p class="topictext">The installation requires extraction of the single executable 
  file and related documentation files from the assignment submission file. This 
  can be achieved using the jar utility which comes with the Java 2 SDK 1.4. Once 
  the executable file has been extracted, it can be executed from a command line 
  session using the jar switch. 
<p class="topictext">If the application is to be started with the server, the 
  configured database file must contain valid header data (optionally, it may 
  also contain data records). If this file does not exist, the server will report 
  a java.io.FileNotFoundException at start up time.
<p class="topictext">For both the server and client part of the application, a 
  file called &quot;suncertify.properties&quot; may optionally exist in the JVM 
  working directory that specifies configuration parameters to the application. 
  If this configuration file does exist, a set of default configuration properties 
  is used. The default values have a data schema defined that is consistent with 
  version 1.0 of the data server. More information on how to configure the application 
  can be found in the <a href="configuring.html">Configuration section</a>.
