<p class="topictitle">Configuring the Application</p>
<p class="topictext">Configuring the client application can be achieved from the main
  application window by invoking the <a href="running.html#configuration">Configuration 
  Dialog </a> action. The application reads a file called &quot;suncertify.properties&quot; 
  from the current working directory at start-up time. This file contains various 
  configuration information that is related to the operation of both the client 
  and server application. If this configuration file does exist, a set of default 
  configuration properties is used. The application will save the configured properties 
  when it closes. The default configuration values have a schema defined that 
  is consistent with version 1.0 of the data server. The client application will 
  not connect to a data source if no schema has been defined, if the client application 
  is in local mode and the data source location has not been specified or if the 
  client application is in networked mode and the JNDI name of the remote object 
  has not been specified. The definition of a data source is dependant on the 
  client application start-up mode. This section explains the meaning of the attributes 
  that are presented in the configuration dialog.</p>
<p class="topictext">Certain attributes of the configuration dialog are &quot;read-only&quot; 
  while the application is connected to a data source. In order to modify these 
  attributes, <a href="running.html#connect">disconnect</a> from the data source.</p>
<p class="topictext">Once the changes have been committed by pressing the 'OK' 
  button, the new suncertify.properties configuration file will be written. To 
  cancel the configuration and prevent writing the configuration changes to file, 
  press the 'Cancel' button.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="schema"></a>Data Schema</p>
<p class="topictext">This panel allows the user to configure the data schema on 
  the client to be consistent with the data schema on the server. The data schemas 
  on the client and the server must be consistent, otherwise, behaviour of the 
  client application is indeterminate. The default configuration provides a schema 
  definition that is consistent with version 1.0 of the data server. The panel 
  allows the user to add new fields to the schema <img src="images/actions/plus16.gif" width="16" height="16">, 
  delete existing fields from the schema <img src="images/actions/minus16.gif" width="16" height="16">, 
  change the order of the fields in the schema <img src="images/moveup16.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  / <img src="images/movedown16.gif" width="16" height="16">, and edit the attributes 
  of each field in the schema. Each field may or may not represent a unique key, 
  has a descriptive display name, and a length in bytes. A panel containing a 
  data schema setting that is consistent with version 1.0 of the server is:</p>

</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="networked"></a>Networked Mode</p>
<p class="topictext">When the client application is <a href="starting.html">started 
  in networked mode</a>, the user must configure the JNDI name of the remote DB 
  object. The client application will not connect to the data source until this 
  has been specified. The default configuration settings use the value &quot;Data&quot;. 
  The user may also optionally specify the host and/or port of the RMI registry 
  to locate the remote DB object on. The host defaults to &quot;localhost&quot; 
  and the port defaults to &quot;1099&quot;. </p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="datafile"></a>Data File</p>
<p class="topictext">The user must configure the location of the database file 
  which is used by the client application when in local mode. The client application 
  (in local mode) will not connect to the data source until this has been specified. 
  This file must exist and must contain valid header data.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="confirm"></a>Confirm Actions </p>
<p class="topictext">The confirm action checkboxes allow the user to configure 
  whether or not certain actions will have a confirmation dialog displayed before 
  performing the action. If the checkbox is checked for an action, the application 
  will confirm with the user before performing that action.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="server"></a>Server Configuration</p>
<p class="topictext">Server configuration is provided by a dialog that is displayed 
  when the application is <a href="starting.html">started in server mode</a>. 
  The dialog allows the user to enter the location of the back-end data source 
  file name, the local TCP port to bind the server to, and the JNDI name to bind 
  the remote data object to. When the user starts the server, the application 
  will become non-responsive and will only respond simple commands, such as exiting 
  the application. There is no ability to stop the server after it has been started, 
  except for exiting the application entirely.</p>
