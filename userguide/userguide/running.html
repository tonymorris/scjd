<p class="topictitle">Running the Client Application</p>
<p class="topictext">While the client application is running, certain actions 
  may be performed using the client interface. The interface contains a tool bar, 
  a set of menu options and a pop-up menu (on a data record only) from which these 
  actions can be invoked. Each action has a short cut &quot;accelerator&quot; 
  key(s) associated with it to alllow operation of the application with the keyboard. 
  Each action may or may not be enabled depending upon the state of the client 
  application. Action icons are usually &quot;grayed-out&quot; when the action 
  is disabled - this is Look and Feel dependent.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="about"></a>About Dialog <img src="images/actions/about16.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  <span class="topictext">(F1)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action brings up a dialog that displays a brief description 
  about the application, click anywhere on the dialog, the main application window 
  or the 'X' close button to close the About dialog. This action is always enabled.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration Dialog <img src="images/actions/preferences16.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  <span class="topictext">(F9)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action brings up a dialog that allows the user to configure 
  the application. Although this action is always enabled, certain configuration 
  attributes on the dialog will be &quot;read-only&quot; when the client application 
  is connected to a data source. The user will not be able to use the main application 
  window while this dialog is being displayed. Click 'OK' to apply the configuration 
  changes or 'Cancel' to cancel any changes - this will close the Configuration 
  Dialog. More information on configuration can be found in the <a href="configuring.html">Configuration 
  section</a>.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="connect"></a>Connect/Disconnect <img src="images/actions/connect16.gif" width="16" height="16">/<img src="images/actions/disconnect16.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  <span class="topictext">(Control-ENTER)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">The connect/disconnect action will connect to the data source 
  if the application is currently disconnected, or disconnect from the data source 
  if the application is currently connected. The data source may be the local 
  data file if the application is in local mode or it will be the remote Data 
  object if the application is in networked mode. This action will always be enabled. 
  See the <a href="starting.html">Starting the Application section</a> for more 
  information on the client application modes.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="copy"></a>Copy Data Record <img src="images/actions/copy16.gif" width="16" height="16"><span class="topictext">(Shift-C)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action will copy the currently selected data record 
  to the system clipboard. This action is only enabled when there is a data record 
  selected and the application is connected to a data source, otherwise, it is 
  disabled. The system clipboard contents can be used outside of the client application.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="create"></a>Create Data Record <img src="images/actions/plus16.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  <span class="topictext">(Control-R)</span> </p>
<p class="topictext">This action will bring up a dialog to allow the entry of 
  a new data record. This action is only enabled when the application is connected 
  to a data source, otherwise, it is disabled. Press 'OK' to commit the new data 
  record to the data source, press the 'Cancel' button to cancel the creation 
  of a new data record.</p>

<p class="topictext">This action will remove the currently selected data record 
  and copy its contents to the system clipboard. If the application is configured 
  to confirm 'Cut data record' operations, a confirmation dialog will appear which 
  will allow the user to cancel the operation if desired. This action is only 
  enabled when there is a data record selected and the application is connected 
  to a data source, otherwise, it is disabled. The system clipboard contents can 
  be used outside of the client application.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="delete"></a>Delete Data Record <img src="images/actions/minus16.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  <span class="topictext">(Delete)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action will deleted the currently selected data record 
  from the data source. If the application is configured to confirm 'Delete data 
  record' operations, a confirmation dialog will appear which will allow the user 
  to cancel the operation if desired. This action is only enabled when there is 
  a data record selected and the application is connected to a data source, otherwise, 
  it is disabled.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="edit"></a>Edit Data Record <img src="images/actions/edit16.gif" width="16" height="16"><span class="topictext">(Space)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action will bring up a dialog to allow the editing of 
  the currently selected data record. This action is only enabled when there is 
  a data record selected and the application is connected to a data source, otherwise, 
  it is disabled. Press 'OK' to commit the edited data record to the data source, 
  press the 'Cancel' button to cancel the editing of the selected data record. 
  This will close the dialog.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="exit"></a>Exit the Application <img src="images/actions/exit16.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  <span class="topictext">(Control-Q)</span> </p>
<p class="topictext">This action will disconnect from the data source (if it is 
  connected) before exiting the application. If the application is configured 
  to confirm 'Exit application' operations, a confirmation dialog will appear 
  which will allow the user to cancel the operation if desired. This action is 
  always enabled.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="paste"></a>Paste Data Record <img src="images/actions/paste16.gif" width="16" height="16"><span class="topictext">(Shift-V)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action will bring up a dialog that contains data from 
  the system clipboard to allow the user to create a new data record from the 
  clipboard contents. If the system clipboard does not contain valid record data, 
  an error will be reported by the application. This action is only enabled when 
  the application is connected to a data source, otherwise, it is disabled. Press 
  'OK' to commit the pasted data record to the data source, press the 'Cancel' 
  button to cancel the creation of the pasted data record.</p>
<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="refreshall"></a>Refresh All Data Records Display

<p class="topicsubtitle"><a name="refresh"></a>Refresh Current Display <img src="images/actions/refresh16.gif" width="16" height="16"><span class="topictext">(F7)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action will refresh with an updated display of data 
  records. If the data record display contains a subset of the total data records 
  in the data source (from a <a href="#search">Search</a>), then only the subset 
  will be updated in the display, otherwise, all records will be updated. This 
  action is only enabled when the application is connected to a data source, otherwise, 
  it is disabled.</p>

  <span class="topictext">(Control-F)</span></p>
<p class="topictext">This action will bring up a dialog to allow the user to enter 
  search criteria for data records. Data records are matched if they start with 
  the given String criteria unless the user specifies to match fields exactly 
  with the check box. The search criteria is case-sensitive. Once the search has 
  been performed, only the data records from the data source that match the given 
  criteria will be displayed. This action is only enabled when the application 
  is connected to a data source, otherwise, it is disabled.</p>
